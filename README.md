# Dialogue_Summarization

Dialogue Summarization Using Advanced NLP Techniques
Welcome to the Dialogue Summarization project! This repository contains the code and resources for developing a sophisticated system designed to process and summarize dialogues efficiently. The project leverages the power of machine learning and natural language processing to extract meaningful information from large volumes of text and present it in concise, coherent summaries.

**Project Overview**
The main goal of this project is to create a robust dialogue summarization system. Here are the key highlights and components of the project:

**Data Collection and Preprocessing**
Dataset: Utilized the "knkarthick/dialogsum" dataset from Hugging Face.
Preprocessing: Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure high-quality input for the model.
Model Development
Model: Implemented and fine-tuned the google/flan-t5-base model, a variant of the T5 architecture.
Learning Approaches: Employed one-shot and few-shot learning to enhance the model's summarization capabilities.
Evaluation and Optimization
Performance Metrics: Assessed using ROUGE and BLEU scores.
Optimization Techniques: Experimented with various generation configurations, including adjusting temperature parameters.
**Deployment**
Technologies: Deployed using Docker and Kubernetes for scalability and seamless integration.
Technologies and Tools Used
